# E-commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard

## **Overview**

This project is an **E-commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, designed to provide business leaders with clear, actionable insights into **sales performance**, **customer behavior**, **profitability**, and **delivery operations**.

Instead of navigating spreadsheets, decision-makers can use this dashboard to make data-driven decisions through interactive charts, filters, and clean reports.
